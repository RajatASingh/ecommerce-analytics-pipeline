## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **modern data engineering pipeline** for e-commerce analytics.  
It simulates a real-world scenario where data is spread across multiple systems and needs to be ingested, processed, and transformed into analytics-ready datasets.  

The pipeline uses **Azure services, Databricks, and multiple data sources** to practice end-to-end data workflows.  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 🔹 Data Sources
- 📂 **GitHub** → Raw CSV files  
- 🗄️ **MySQL Server** → Relational data  
- 🗄️ **MongoDB Server** → NoSQL data  

### 🔹 Data Ingestion (Azure Data Factory)
- Configured **linked services** for all sources.  
- Used **Copy Activity** pipelines to ingest data into **Azure Data Lake Gen2**.  

### 🔹 Data Lakehouse (Medallion Architecture)
- **Bronze Layer** → Raw, synced data from all sources  
- **Silver Layer** → Cleaned & standardized data  
- **Gold Layer** → Final curated datasets for analytics  

### 🔹 Processing (Databricks + PySpark)
- Created a **Databricks service** to read data from **ADLS (bronze layer)**.  
- Connected Databricks directly to **MongoDB** using Spark connector.  
- Performed:
  - Data cleaning & transformations  
  - Joining relational + NoSQL datasets  
  - Preparing **analytics-ready tables** in gold layer

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Programming**: Python, PySpark  
- **Orchestration**: Azure Data Factory  
- **Storage**: Azure Data Lake Gen2  
- **Processing**: Azure Databricks  
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB  
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## 🚀 Pipeline Workflow
1. **Raw Data Upload** → GitHub stores initial CSVs.  
2. **Ingestion** → ADF pipelines copy data from MySQL, MongoDB, and GitHub → ADLS (bronze).  
3. **Bronze → Silver → Gold** → Data flows through medallion architecture layers.  
4. **Processing** → Databricks + Spark clean, join, and transform data.  
5. **Final Datasets** → Analytics-ready tables prepared for BI/reporting.  

---

## 🎯 Key Features
- Multi-source ingestion (GitHub, MySQL, MongoDB → ADLS).  
- Medallion (bronze, silver, gold) layered architecture.  
- Spark-based transformations in Databricks.  
- Handles both **structured** and **unstructured** data.  

---

## 📊 Future Enhancements
- ✅ Add **data quality checks** (Great Expectations / PyDeequ).  
- ✅ Build **Power BI or Tableau dashboards** on top of gold datasets.  
- ✅ Automate deployment with **CI/CD** (Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions).

🔥 With this pipeline, you practice **real-world data engineering concepts** like data ingestion, medallion architecture, distributed processing, and orchestration.
